# Lashes-By-Emalee

## Purpose
<p>This project was created for my wife, Emalee, to assist with her eye lash business. 
Emalee was having issues keeping track of all the information for her customers, as there are many different styles and tools she could have used during the last appointment.
This website allows her to create customers and appointments, storing all the data she needs to keep track of. 
She can then view this data on a table by searching for the customer, as well as view all previous appointments.</p>

## Tools used
JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgresSQL, Express, Tabulator
